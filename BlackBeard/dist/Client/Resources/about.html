Find yourself a crew, build yourself a ship, and set sail in search of loot! Raid with your friends, capture the booty, and spend it in port to upgrade your weapons and your ship!</p>
<p>In this fast paced, first person, booty-stealing monstrosity of a game, players can join a crew, purchase a ship, and fight it out with their &ldquo;buddies&rdquo; to get the greatest hoard!</p>
<p>Instructions:<br />Launcher<br />Enter the ip address of a server, your username and password, then click the launch button to enter the game.<br />In game:<br />Use the W,A,S,and D keys to move. Turn by using the mouse. Left click to attack. Right click to operate.<br />Tiller:<br />Right click on the tiller to operate. Then, use the left and right arrow keys to turn this ship.<br />Cannon:<br />Right click to load,then right click to fire. Ammunition will be automatically deducted from the ship&rsquo;s inventory.<br />Go to the port for upgrades!<br />Press ctrl-q to quit.</p>

<p>Class list:</p>
<p>==============================CLIENT=CLASSES================================</p>
<p>PACKAGE client.net.frontend<br />#contains classes that are most closely related to gameplay.<br />ClientConnector - A GUI interface for the launcher<br />Client - The centralized location for the package.</p>
<p>PACKAGE client.net.backend<br />#contains classes that directly communicate with the Server and are interfaced only through the front end classes.<br />ServerListener - Used to communicate with Server.<br />StopWatch - A timer used for ping.</p>
<p>PACKAGE world.constants.declaration<br />#serves as a dynamic configuration for the code<br />&lt;&lt;MConstants&gt;&gt; -replacement for PConstants as Processing does not work with java 1.6 and below.<br />&lt;&lt;NetworkConstants&gt;&gt; - Holds commands and replies used by the net backend classes.<br />&lt;&lt;ViewConstants&gt;&gt; - Used to configure the render range and viewport statistics used by the viewport classes.</p>
<p>PACKAGE world.constructs.blocks<br />#contains all the blocks that can make up the land.<br />Barrier - Empty, stops player.<br />BGBlock - Not clippable, is background<br />Block - Common Superclass for all blocks<br />BlockTemplate - For copy paste new blocks.<br />Clay - Red clay<br />&lt;&lt;Clippable&gt;&gt; - Interface, defines methods used to clip blocks. (and draw)<br />Grass - simple green block<br />Null - Barrier, but without the wire frame.<br />Obsidian - like in MINECRAFT<br />SensorBlock - Used to detect spaces adjacent to the player.<br />Stone - Simple gray block<br />Teapot - I had to put this in, singe Glut defines a method Glut.glutSolidTeapot(float f). It is great&hellip;</p>
<p>PACKAGE world.constructs.silver<br />#PLAF - defines custom look and feel for menu bars for swing integration with jogl.<br />SilverLookAndFeel.java</p>
<p>PACKAGE world.debug.exceptions<br />#contains special exceptions used as information carriers by the backend classes.<br />NetworkException - general fault, error code specified in creation.<br />ShortCircuitException - if reflexive operation required for stealing Unsafe fails, or it Allocation of Off-Heap matrix causes sigkill.</p>
<p>PACKAGE world.io<br />#contains IO classes that suppress exceptions and send error codes instead.<br />FileWrapper - supports both reading and writing to a file.<br />Printer - takes advantage of computer&rsquo;s printer.<br />Handle - calls UnsafeTools.getUnsafe(). Hides reflexion in background. As called, provides a handle for classes to get ahold of an Unsafe instance despite its private constructor. Unsafe is in package sun.misc.unsafe. In this case, it is used for two things: CAS (Underlying Atomic classes) and pointers. Off-heap memory is safe from the java GC, and so one can leave it and increment pointers to get back to it. May cause memory leaks&hellip; I know sun.misc.Unsafe is probably gone if you are using idk 9+, so Michael bundled it into a jar file (He stole the are 1.8 rt.jar and added a handle for ease of use.)</p>
<p>PACKAGE world.ui<br />#Contains classes for setting up the initial gui.<br />JoglMenu - wrapper to JMenuBar with default set of menus.</p>
<p>PACKAGE world.viewport<br />#Oh boy, the REAAAAL guts of the program.<br />Camera - provides a first person view using glFrustum and ortho modes. Calculates perspective handling and stores attributes of the GL viewport.<br />Grid - Provides a viewport handle for the Block list<br />JoglPane - extends JPanel implements GLEventListener - provides the frame on which everything is based.<br />MVector - Michael got mad with processing (his computer had Java 1.6) so he wrote his own vector class that just happens to support using doubles.<br />Player - extends Camera, performs collision checking with block list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />==========================SERVER=CLASSES================================<br />PACKAGE server.net<br />#provides ALL the classes needed for a server to run.<br />ServerGUI - provides a basic GUI for the Server<br />Server - provides centralized location for communication with the clients.<br />ServerConnector - talks with clientconnector to initialize a connection.<br />ServerMain - setup for Server</p>
<p>PACKAGE server.world.constructs<br />#The ship, mostly<br />Building - a building. When randomly generating a map, packaging a building allows you to plop it down wherever after generation.<br />Ship - provides a platform for players to stand on. Measures its own coordinates in ABSOLUTE COORDINATES. Players measure their coordinates relative to their ship, and only absolute when not on a ship.<br />CoordinateTransform - extends awt affinetransform - to support rotational motion.</p>
<p>PACKAGE server.io <br />#provides classes essential to management of multiple streams.<br />IOStream - Like in cpp.</p>
<p>PACKAGE server.mirrors<br />#mirrors players to ensure compliance.<br />Player - realistic velocity, probably won&rsquo;t happen as we may not have time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Class assignments: <br />For optimal intergration, people get packages, not classes. If you get a package, you get all the classes inside that package.</p>
